# 🔍 Optimizer Comparison

Welcome to **Optimizer Comparison**, a project designed to explore and analyze the performance of various optimization algorithms in machine learning. This project compares different optimizers across multiple datasets and model types to better understand their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

---

## 📌 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Understand how different optimization algorithms perform across various datasets.
- Compare convergence speed, accuracy, loss behavior, and stability.
- Visualize learning curves and performance metrics for deeper insight.

---

## 🧠 Optimizers Covered

This project currently includes evaluations of the following optimizers:
- SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
- SGD with Momentum
- AdaGrad
- RMSprop
- Adam

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

We are testing the optimizers on a range of datasets, including:
- **MNIST** – Handwritten digit recognition (image classification)
- **Fashion-MNIST** – Zalando's article images for clothing classification (image classification)
- **CIFAR-10** – Object recognition in images

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics are used to compare optimizer performance:

* Training/Validation Accuracy
* Loss Curves
* Convergence Speed (epochs/time)
* Generalization Gap
* Learning Stability (variance over runs)

---

## 📎 Future Work

* Add more optimizers (e.g., AdaMax, LAMB, Lion)
* Test on NLP datasets (e.g., text classification)
* Explore learning rate schedules and adaptive mechanisms
* Incorporate advanced visualizations (e.g., loss landscape plots)
